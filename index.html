    <p>
      All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental technologies</em>
      : HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web. 
      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
        about, and why you too should learn it.
      </p>

    </p>
    <h3>What is HTML</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <stron>L</stron>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
    </p>
   
     <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <lo>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </lo>
    <p>

      >MDN web docs</a>
    </p>


    <h3>Why should yuo learn Html</h3>
    <p>
      There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:
    </p>

<ul>
  <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
  <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
  <li>To build web applications</li>
  <li>To impress friends</li>
  <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
